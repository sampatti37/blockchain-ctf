## Start here: https://blockchain-ctf.netlify.app/

## Instructions

Start at the web level and follow the instructions there.

After downloading the CTF, unzip it either in a linux machine or on the terminal at: https://coding.csel.io/

Read each README or instruction pdf on how to complete that level and get your flag.

Submit all your flags to the smart contract from the final level to get your Buff Token!

## Project

For our final project, we created a blockchain CTF. This CTF if more focused on teaching blockchain concepts to players, rather than being an extremely difficult web3/blockchain only CTF like paradigm. Our CTF covers many fundamental blockchain concepts like block hashing and construction of chains to proof of work and interacting with a smart contract, to more specific concepts like zero knowledge proofs and reentrancy attacks.
